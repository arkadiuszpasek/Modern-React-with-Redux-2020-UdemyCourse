# My repository for Udemy Course by Stephen Grider: Modern React with Redux [2020 Update]

## What's installed: 
- ESLint
- Faker - for mock images and text
- prop-types - for props validation
- redux, react-redux
- redux-thunk
- lodash

- Semantic UI css - ready to use css, for quicker code production

- App uses *Unsplash Api*, which requires key, so at some point in the future the autorizations might fail
